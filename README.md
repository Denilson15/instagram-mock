# Instagram Mock

This is a custom-built Instagram-style post feed developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice responsive layout and frontend development skills.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://astounding-dolphin-1be4e5.netlify.app/](https://astounding-dolphin-1be4e5.netlify.app/)

This project showcases a clean, mobile-first design that mimics an Instagram feed. It includes:

- A header with logo and navigation icons
- A responsive feed layout displaying user posts
- Interactive elements for user engagement

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each post is dynamically rendered using a hardcoded list of user data in the JavaScript file.
- The layout uses **Flexbox** to stack post elements vertically with spacing and responsiveness.
- Interaction buttons (like, comment, share) are present for UI practice, and can be expanded with functionality later.
- JavaScript handles rendering post elements into the DOM using basic iteration over the post data.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Built the layout and styling from scratch
- Customized content and icon layout
- Structured the JavaScript logic to loop through post data and generate UI elements dynamically

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Expand layout for better desktop responsiveness
- Add like/comment functionality
- Enhance visual effects with animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the page
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for rendering post content and interactions
